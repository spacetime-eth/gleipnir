# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat typechain
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

- run ganache
- npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network ganache
- yarn dev (front end)
- Add network on Metamask
- Connect with account from Ganache on Metamask
- On .env.local add CONTRACT_ADDRESS from Ganache
